# Kombucha üìñ  üçé

### What Is Kombucha? 

Kombucha is a fully integrated, end-to-end educational platform for the Vanderbilt Undergraduate Microbiome Society (VUMS). 

### Technical Requirements

Kombucha is a full-stack application build from the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) Stack. 

### Additional Information

Our project is a web-based educational platform wherein administrators can upload and modify content and users can view said content, specifically tailor-made for the Vanderbilt University Microbiome Society (VUMS). This content may include videos, articles, interactive pages, graphics, comics and other such mediums. Additional functionalities include creating a game interface for administrators to be able to present content and articles in an easy-to-understand and enjoyable fashion for the end user. This game will be closely tied with the educational content to ensure a seamless user experience. Consequently, our intention is to immerse the user with the material that the administrators plan to upload and create. We intend to facilitate this process by creating an easy-to-navigate user interface for both administrators and users, and allow VUMS to share, update, disseminate and delete their educational material while advertising their impactful volunteering activities in the local community, similar to Vanderbilt‚Äôs current AnchorLink service.
